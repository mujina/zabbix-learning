###Gettting started on Docker. 

My approach was to buy this book from leanpub for about Â£10. 

[https://leanpub.com/dockerforsysadmins](https://leanpub.com/dockerforsysadmins)

Ping me and I'll send you a copy to review before you purchase it. 

Also Nigel Poulton has some great Docker tutorials on Pluralsight.

It's a PAYG video training sight, but well worth the investment. 

In this directory a docker-compose file for running Zabbix. 

First install docker using your package manager, then install docker compose and run 

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

This will give you a full Zabbix stack for learning on your local machine at 

[http://localhost/zabbix](http://localhost/zabbix)

Default user Admin pass zabbix

When you've got this far read the following resources to get started. 

What you just did:

And a quickstart tutorial for your new environment
